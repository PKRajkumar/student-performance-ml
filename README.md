# Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts student academic performance using a real-world Kaggle dataset.  
The goal is to understand how various factors influence student scores and to apply a complete machine learning workflow.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Students Performance in Exams
- **Records:** ~1000 students
- **Features:** Gender, parental education, lunch type, test preparation
- **Target:** Final performance score (average of math, reading, and writing scores)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- Type: Supervised Learning
- Algorithm: Linear Regression

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data preprocessing and encoding  
3. Feature selection and target creation  
4. Model training using Linear Regression  
5. Model evaluation using MAE and R² score  

## 📈 Results
The model achieved reasonable accuracy and demonstrated the relationship between student background factors and academic performance.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Use advanced models like Random Forest
- Feature engineering
- Cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
